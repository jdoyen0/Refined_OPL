# Refined_OPL
Refined One Page Links (OPL) is a responsive single web page template for easily saving and organizing web links. It is ideal for teams who would like to have a simple, shared bookmarks page. No need to pay for a bookmark manager. All links are automatically sorted alphabetically and searchable.

# Quickstart
Simply copy the main.html page to your webserver and change the name to fit your project. To customize the links within the page, simply change the values in the "const links = []" list. You can easily embed your custom hosted version of this links page inside of another page using an iframe.
