# Refined_OPL
Refined One Page Links (OPL) is a responsive single web page template for easily saving and organizing web links. It is ideal for teams who would like to have a simple, shared bookmarks page. No need to pay for a bookmark manager. All links are automatically sorted alphabetically and searchable. This can be hosted on a web server or cached as a file on an endpoint / file server. Use it however you want!

# Quickstart
Simply copy the main.html page to your webserver or save it as a file on an endpoint / file server. To customize the links within the page, simply change the values in the "const links = []" list. You can easily embed your custom hosted version of this links page inside of another page using an iframe.
