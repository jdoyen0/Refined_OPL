# Refined_OPL
Refined One Page Links (OPL) is a responsive single web page template for easily saving and organizing web links. It is ideal for teams who would like to have a simple, shared bookmarks page. No need to pay for a bookmark manager. All links are automatically sorted alphabetically and searchable.

# Quickstart
Simply copy the main.html page to your webserver and change the name of the file to whatever you'd like. To customize the links within the page, simply change the values in the "const links = []" list. You can easily embed your version of the links page inside of another page on your website using an iframe.
